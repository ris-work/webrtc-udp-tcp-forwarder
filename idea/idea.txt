The idea is that a TOML file is read and decided what to do with it. It has offer or connect mode. The mode name is entirely in terms of WebRTC. Connect mode reads an offer from the TOML file and connects to the end point using the described parameters on the file. The file can also be an FIFO buffer, it does not matter.

The file should contain:
ICE (STUN/TURN) parameters
Should UDP/TCP be 'listened' or is there any UDP/TCP port to send packets to


Offer mode:
First argument is the configuration for the daemon, UDP or WebRTC
Stdout gives the negotiation info in JSON

Accept mode:
First argument is the configuration for the daemon and has the offer
Stdout gives the accepted parameters in JSON

The stdin/stdout are scriptable and used for signalling when ready.
